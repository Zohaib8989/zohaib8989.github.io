3PL Dashboard Development for eCommerce Company

Completion Dates: September 2022

 **Objective:** Created a comprehensive 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) Dashboard using Power BI to provide the eCommerce company with detailed insights into logistics costs and trends.

**Key Achievements:**

- **Data Integration:** Utilized ScanPower API to fetch real-time and historical data, ensuring the dashboard's data accuracy and timeliness.

- **Data Transformation:** Designed and executed data transformation processes within Power BI to clean, structure, and prepare the raw data for analysis.

- **Vendor Cost Trends:** Developed a visual representation of 3PL cost trends per vendor, enabling the company to identify cost-saving opportunities and make data-driven decisions.

- **Unit Cost Trends:** Implemented dynamic visualizations for single prep and multi prep unit cost trends, facilitating better cost management and operational optimization.

- **Invoice Discrepancy Resolution:** Discovered a significant discrepancy in 3PL vendor invoices where they were charging the multi-pack price even when the Unit of Measure (UOM) was equal to the Case Quantity.

- **Cost Recovery:** Through the insights provided by the dashboard, the company was able to identify and rectify these discrepancies, resulting in a substantial cost recovery of over $500,000 from various 3PL vendors over a six-month period.

- **Operational Impact:** The dashboard not only improved cost management but also led to substantial savings and better vendor invoice verification processes.

- **Positive Feedback:** Received commendation from company stakeholders for delivering a valuable tool that not only enhanced cost control but also led to significant cost recovery.

This project demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis, integration, and visualization, leading to substantial cost recoveries and operational improvements for the company.
